        "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It allows for the hiding of implementation details and the protection of data from unauthorized access. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class called the base class or parent class. The class that inherits from the base class is called the derived class or child class. Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent multiple types of objects. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a derived class).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of representing essential features of an entity while hiding the irrelevant details. It involves defining a simplified interface for interacting with objects, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction allows for the creation of complex systems by breaking them down into manageable components with well-defined interfaces.\n",
